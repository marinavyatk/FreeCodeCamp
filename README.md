# FreeCodeCamp
I'm learning to code with the FreeCodeCamp. Here I will post solutions to HTML & CSS ([Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)) and JS ([JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)) tasks. You can find it in the appropriate folders.
